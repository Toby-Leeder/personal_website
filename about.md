Hi, I’m Toby, a student at UC Berkeley studying Applied Mathematics and Data Science. When I’m not wrangling numbers, you’ll probably find me on stage. This past summer I performed in a musical: The Prom! At UC Berkeley you’ll find me managing both the stage and the finances at BareStage Productions. 

I grew up in sunny San Diego with my twin brother and younger brother, but I’ve been lucky enough to travel far beyond–15 countries so far, with Thailand as the all-time favorite.

I also tutor math, physics, and SAT prep, but outside of academics, I’m a bit of a gamer. On League of Legends I’m always up for a good match, and in Teamfight Tactics I’ve climbed into the top 5% of players in North America. 

Fun fact: I was a child actor and model, you might still spot me on an old billboard somewhere. I once shot an ad campaign in Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s house (aka Sarah Michelle Gellar), and you can even catch me as a baby in season 3 of The Office.

## Concept
Leeding Tomorrow is a professional site for educator **Ariella Leeder**, built to showcase her offerings in **College Coaching** and **Future Problem Solving (FPS)**. The website provides program summaries, personal background, and clear scheduling/contact CTAs for prospective students and families.

- **Target audience:** Students and parents seeking coaching or FPS enrichment.
- **Goal:** Encourage contact and consultation bookings.
- **Tone:** Warm, knowledgeable, and trustworthy.

## What I Built
I designed and built the site, including layout, styling, content polish, and conversion-focused UX.

### Pages:
- **Homepage:** Overview of FPS & College Coaching, with educator intro and direct CTAs.
- **College Coaching:** Stubbed for future content, with prominent email/schedule CTA.
- **Future Problem Solving:** Explanations of FPS components, linked resources, embedded video.
- **About Me:** Educator’s background, philosophy, and affiliations.
- **Blog:** Placeholder scaffold ready for future posts.

### Features:
- Multiple conversion CTAs: email, direct phone, **Calendly**.
- Optimized mobile layout and clear hierarchy.
- Friendly, education-themed visuals and typography.
- Zoning for future scalability (more pages or blog content).

## Notes
- One challenge was distilling **Future Problem Solving** into parent-friendly summaries while still capturing the depth of each component. I also structured the site to allow easy growth without redesign.
- Worked solo, balancing IA, UX writing, responsiveness, and site testing.

## Outcomes
- Client now has a professional digital presence and has begun booking consultations.
- Visitors get a clear sense of offerings and next steps.
- Blog and College Coaching page can be filled out later with no structural changes needed.

> Feedback so far: Easier to explain offerings and guide families to Calendly.

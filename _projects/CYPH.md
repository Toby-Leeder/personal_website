## Concept
A brief, audience‑friendly explanation of the project’s goal—what the experience is and why it’s interesting.

## What I Built
- Your specific contributions (features, components, scripts, data processing).
- Any challenges (e.g., media pipeline, performance, file handling, UX trade‑offs).

## Notes
- Architecture/stack choices and why they fit the problem.
- How collaboration, testing, or deployment worked (if applicable).

## Outcome
What you learned, feedback received, or where the project is headed next.

## Concept
A game with fun and happy vibes with serious undertones about getting over trauma, finding forgiveness, and becoming a better person. 

- Setting: Purgatory, a place between heaven and earth
- Goal: Help the other 3 find their happiness and ascend to heaven
- Story: Completing a character quest unlocks a piece of memory for Carrie
- Gameplay: Complete minigames to help the other 3 people in Purgatory and discover who these people really are!

## What I Built
- I developed the three minigames associated with each character. 

### First minigame: 
- A platformer in which Carrie must chase the Boy to the end of the map and eventually catch him. 

### Second minigame: 
- A stealth style sneaking game, where Carrie must avoid being spotted by the Woman and reach an important object. 

### Third minigame:
- A dodging game where Carrie must avoid beer bottles which split and shatter in multiple pieces. 


- One challenge I faced was using my animation pipeline to correctly show the movements of the characters during the first platformer minigame. I had never used the animatior before, so I had to learn how to import the animation keyframes given to me by my artist team. I then had to discover how to design the animator to switch between jumping and running/walking correctly once landing. Because the jump was always the same, I timed the animation speed with the jump to make the flow look the nicest. 

## Notes
- The project team included 2 developers and 3 artists. Over the course of a month we developed skeletons of the games simultaneous to the artists developing sprites. Through this I gained experience working with a team of people and navigating the challenges that come with that. Especially for a group of college students, everyone was busy and had other responsibilities, so I had to manage our time and capabilities effectively to eventually complete our final project.
